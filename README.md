## üß© Solution Overview

Deploy a simple web application on AWS using EC2 instances, ensuring high availability and scalability with Elastic Load Balancing (ALB) and Auto Scaling Groups (ASG). The project demonstrates best practices for compute scalability, security, and cost optimization.

This solution automatically provisions networking, compute, storage, monitoring, and CDN resources in a modular fashion. The infrastructure follows best practices and supports the following capabilities:

- Frontend and backend tiers run on EC2 instances in Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs).
- Compute resources are split across multiple Availability Zones to improve fault tolerance.
- Amazon RDS is used to host a managed, persistent database layer.
- Amazon CloudFront is used to serve static assets and frontend content globally, reducing latency.
- AWS CloudWatch is used to monitor CPU metrics and trigger alarms.
- Security Groups provide strict access control between components.
- Scripts (UserData) allow automatic installation of web server software (e.g., NGINX, Apache, etc.).

This solution can serve as a production-ready base infrastructure for hosting any modern web application, such as an e-commerce platform, content management system (CMS), or microservice-based backend API.

## üñº Architecture Diagram

The 3-Tier architecture consists of the following components:

1. **Frontend Tier**
   - Deployed in a public subnet.
   - Uses Auto Scaling Group with EC2 instances.
   - UserData installs a web server and optionally connects to the backend API.
   - Content is accelerated globally via Amazon CloudFront.

2. **Backend Tier**
   - Deployed in a private subnet.
   - Backend EC2 instances handle business logic and connect securely to the database.
   - ASG ensures dynamic scaling based on load.

3. **Database Tier**
   - Amazon RDS is provisioned in a private subnet.
   - Accessible only via backend Security Group.

4. **Networking**
   - VPC with 2 or more Availability Zones.
   - Public and private subnets separated via route tables.
   - Internet Gateway for frontend traffic, and NAT Gateway for backend EC2 outbound internet.

5. **Monitoring and Scaling**
   - CloudWatch monitors CPU, triggers alarms, and can be extended with custom metrics.
   - Auto Scaling policies respond to traffic spikes.

6. **Security**
   - Each tier has its own Security Group with least-privilege access.
   - SSH access is managed using a key pair created via Terraform.

The overall infrastructure is highly modular, making it easy to extend with services like AWS WAF, ALB, or S3 static hosting.

This Terraform-based project deploys a production-ready **3-tier architecture** designed for web applications. It separates application concerns across:
- **Frontend Layer**: Serves static and dynamic content to end users.
- **Backend Layer**: Handles business logic and API endpoints.
- **Database Layer**: Manages persistent storage using RDS.

Key Features:
- Highly Available across multiple Availability Zones
- Automatically Scalable using AWS Auto Scaling Groups
- Modular Design using Terraform modules for reusability
- Monitoring with CloudWatch and log collection
- Fast Global Content Delivery via CloudFront

## üß± Terraform Modules

The project is structured using isolated modules to separate concerns and ease maintenance.

| Module      | Purpose                                      |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `vpc`       | Defines custom VPC, public/private subnets   |
| `SecGroups` | Sets up tiered security groups               |
| `key`       | Handles SSH key pair for EC2 access          |
| `FrontEnd`  | Provisions EC2 for frontend and UserData     |
| `BackEnd`   | Deploys backend EC2 services                 |
| `ASG`       | Auto Scaling for front and backend tiers     |
| `DB`        | RDS database provisioning                    |
| `CloudWatch`| Alarm and metrics for monitoring             |
| `CloudFront`| CDN for frontend acceleration                |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customizing the Solution

You can easily tailor this infrastructure to suit different applications by:
- Updating variable values in `variables.tf`
- Modifying `UserData` scripts to install your stack (Node, Python, PHP, etc.)
- Adding new modules for S3 buckets, Lambda, etc.
